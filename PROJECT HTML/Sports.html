<q><i><big>Jump and Hit</i></big></q> <b>Club Volleyball provides opportunities for players and coaches who enjoy volleyball to participate in a quality program 
catering to various levels of play beyond the traditional school season. The BC club season runs from January to May – with 
many clubs hosting try outs in December / early January.
For players pursuing the Team BC High Performance Program, club participation is an essential part of their development.
Youth Club Volleyball policies and directions are determined by the Volleyball BC Regional Development Committee with assistance
from Volleyball BC staff. This committee is comprised of the regional managers, staff and volunteer members from various regions.
Please read below for information on club volleyball, including, but not limited to, our club handbook, competition calendar and FAQs.

<h2><u>Basketball</u></h2>
<img src="Basketball.jpg"><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>
<b></b>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary 
objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 
10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth
two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a 
technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws.
The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, 
players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; 
either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without 
dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.<b>

<b>Archery is the sport, practice, or skill of using a bow to shoot arrows.The word comes from the Latin arcus, meaning bow. Historically,
archery has been used for hunting and combat.In modern times, it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity. 
A person who practices archery is typically called an archer, bowman, or toxophilite
 <b>Health and fitness benefits of archery</b>
 Archery offers a number of health and fitness benefits, including:
 Developing arm muscles and upper body strength.
 Boosting hand-eye coordination skills.
 Improving mental strength and concentration.
 Honing the flexibility of the hands and fingers.
 Freeing the mind from everyday distractions, by focusing it.<b>

<h2><u>Football</u></h2>
<img src="football.jpeg"><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>
<b>A football team is a group of players selected to play together in the various team sports known as football. Such teams could be 
selected to play in a match against an opposing team, to represent a football club, group, state or nation, an all-star team or even
selected as a hypothetical team (such as a Dream Team or Team of the Century) and never play an actual match.
There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.
Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.
The expansion of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly
controlled Empire.[8] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example,
deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[9] In 1888, The Football
League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 20th century, several of the 
various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.<b></p>


<h2><u>Badminton</u></h2>
<img src="badminton.jpg"><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p>
<b></b>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams,
the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is
often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are
scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or
if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.
The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports.
In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top
speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.
The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark
but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer
Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles, with mixed doubles added
four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength,
speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.<b>

<h2><u>Swimmimg</u></h2>

<p>
<b>Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place
in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance
events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these individual events, four swimmers
can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke,
ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.
Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning the acceptable
form for each individual stroke. There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are
allowed at competitions. Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport, such as
tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport.<b>
